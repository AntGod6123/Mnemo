## 🧠 Architecture

- **Backend**: Python FastAPI with modular services (ZIM loader, search, LLM, translation)
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS for a fast, responsive UI
- **Storage**: SQLite (bookmarks, user profiles, config)
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for backend and frontend

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AntGod6123/Mnemo.git
cd mnemo-browser
docker-compose up --build

``` 

This command builds the backend and frontend containers. After they start,
visit <http://localhost:3000> to use the interface. The FastAPI backend is
available at <http://localhost:8000>. If you want LLM features, run your own
service separately (for example an Ollama container) and configure its URL in
the admin panel. When you're done, stop the stack with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>
and clean up the containers using:

```bash
docker-compose down

```

Argos Translate models for common languages are installed automatically during
the build. You can refresh them at any time from the **Server Settings** dialog
by clicking <kbd>Update Argos Models</kbd>.

### Enabling LLM Features

Open the admin panel and supply the URL and API key of your own LLM service.
Unchecking the option hides these fields and disables AI responses in the
search interface.

### Customizing Collections

Admins can provide custom titles and images for each ZIM file. In the server
settings dialog, edit the **Collection Overrides** JSON field. Keys are the
ZIM filenames and values may include `title` and `image` URLs:

```json
{
  "wikipedia_en.zim": { "title": "Wikipedia", "image": "/static/wiki.png" }
}
```
These overrides appear on the home page grid after saving and reloading.
